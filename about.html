<p>Hi my name is Tim here is me in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I am a senior software engineer at the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>&nbsp;living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorley">Chorley,
            UK</a>.</li>
    <li>Married&nbsp;to&nbsp;my beautiful wife&nbsp;Kirsty.</li>
    <li>Back in 2011 I left&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uclan.ac.uk/">UCLAN</a> with a BSc Hons in Software
        Engineering.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Although I do drive a car, I also have a Kawasaki Vulcan VN900 Custom&nbsp;that I try and get out on
        whenever to opportunity arises.</li>
    <li>When Iâ€™m not riding my bike I like to take picture of things, have a look on my <a title="Photography" href="https://www.timperry.co.uk/photography/">photography
            page</a> if you are interested.</li>
    <li>I also enjoy playing Games on my PS4 and PS Vita. Yes I am a little bit of a Sony fan but I also have a
        Xbox one.</li>
</ul>
