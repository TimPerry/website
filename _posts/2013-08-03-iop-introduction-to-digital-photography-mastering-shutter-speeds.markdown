This article contains my notes for the IOP course.

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15.203125px;">Anything below 1/60th of a second for the shutter speed and you will need a tripod.</span></li>
<li>Halving and doubling
<ul>
<li>e.g. f/11 and 1/250 shutter speed, move the aperture down one stop to f/8 will require you to move the shutter speed up to 1/500.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changing the shutter speed is isolation is never a good idea as usually you also require to change the aperture and ISO settings.</li>
<li>Shutter speeds:
<ul>
<li>1/1000 - Freeze fast moving objects (cars/motorcycles)</li>
<li>1/500 - Freeze moving objects (bikes or joggers)</li>
<li>1/250 - Freeze slow moving objects (slow moving animals/people walking)</li>
<li>1/60 - Panning moving objects close to the camera</li>
<li>1/30 - Panning moving objects a distance away from the camera</li>
<li>1/15 - Panning slow moving objects( slow moving animals)</li>
<li>1/8 - Blurring fast-flowing water close to the camera</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To achieve a very sharp image you require the fastest shutter speed as possible.</li>
<li>And to achieve a blurred image you would require the slowest shutter speed possible.</li>
<li>When selecting your shutter speed you must consider camera shake, remember anything below 1/60th of a second will require a tripod.</li>
<li>Another important factor to consider in blur is focal length, this is because camera have is multiplied when zoomed in.</li>
<li>The general rule of thumb is 1/Focal length (mm) = Minimum shutter speed (seconds) e.g:
<ul>
<li>Focal length 50mm - Minimum shutter speed of 1/50</li>
<li>Focal length 600mm - Minimum shutter speed of 1/600</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember to consider the crop factor in this calculation.</li>
<li><strong>TOPTIP:</strong> Manufactures have ranges of lenses for cropped image sensor cameras like the nikon DX range, meaning you don't need consider the crop factor.</li>
<li>Panning tutorial:<ol>
<li>Get into a good position where you wont be disturbed and have a good range of movement.</li>
<li>Rehearse your shot, practise moving the camera with the subject in the center of the viewfinder.</li>
<li>Use shutter priority, start off with 1/60.</li>
<li>As the subject approaches, track its progress smoothly.</li>
<li>As you pan, half press the shutter button to focus.</li>
<li>take the shot when your subject is in the center of the frame, gently press the shutter button to avoid any uneeded camera shake.</li>
<li>Continue panning with your subject until the shutter closes.</li>
<li>even after the shot has been taking, continue panning to keep the motion smooth.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Use continuos mode to improve the chances of getting it right.</li>
<li>Another technique is fixed point shooting, which gives you the opposite of panning, so the background is in focus and the subject is blurred.</li>
<li>Fixed point tutorial:<ol>
<li>Keep the camera focussed on a fixed point in the scene.</li>
<li>Choose a slow shutter speed.</li>
<li>Press the shutter button.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Architectural photography<ol>
<li>Get the camera setup on a tripod.</li>
<li>Choose a shutter speed of 1 second.</li>
<li>Take the shot.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This will create a perfectly exposed background in sharp focus and very blurred and almost ghostly image in front of it.</li>
</ul>
