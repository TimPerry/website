This article contains my notes for the IOP course.

<ul>
<li>Exposure control
<ul>
<li>Each f-stops either halfs or doubles the amount of light.</li>
<li>Large aperture will give you a background which is out of focus, e.g. f2</li>
<li>A small aperture will give you a image with everything in focus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depth of field
<ul>
<li>is influenced by three important factors<ol>
<li>how far away your subject is from your camera lens</li>
<li>the aperture</li>
<li>the focal length</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spot metering
<ul>
<li>Works by measuring light in only one small spot of the centre of the viewfinder. This cuts out too much light and can lead to more accurate exposure.</li>
<li>Good if you have a very light or dark background compared to the subject.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hand-held exposure meter
<ul>
<li>External meter</li>
<li>Allows you to correctly place the meter, like correctly placing the thermostat in your house.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sunny f/16 rule
<ul>
<li>Set aperture to f/16</li>
<li>Set the shutter speed and iso setting to 100.</li>
<li>Adjust as needed.</li>
<li>f/16 - sunny</li>
<li>f/11 - slightly cloudy</li>
<li>f/8 - cloudy</li>
<li>f/5.6 - heavy cloud</li>
<li>f/4 - sunset</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bracketing
<ul>
<li>Taking a few shots with different exposure settings to identify the optimum settings.</li>
<li>Auto bracketing does this for you automatically, allowing you to choose later on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exposure compensation
<ul>
<li>You can set the exposure manually using a technique called exposure compensation.</li>
<li>You can set the exposure compensation mount up to +/- 2 stop in 1/2 stop increments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
