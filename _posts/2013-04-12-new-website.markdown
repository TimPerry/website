Once again I have redesign Applicious and again this time I hope to use it for more than a root website. This time I am determined! I have removed all the links and used funcionality, this will be a blog site nothing more and nothing less.

<p>Right lets get down to business. I will be writing both tutorials and general blog items which will most probably range from bored little rants to full on articles that might actually be worth reading.</p>
<p>A forewarning, content on this website will be whatever I want, if you do not agree with something I have said then please do let me know. However if you just want to argue for the sake of it then please go murder your self with a brick :)</p>
