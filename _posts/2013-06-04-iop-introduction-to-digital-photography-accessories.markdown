Continuing with IOP, today I finish off unit one (essential accessories).

<ul>
<li>Filters
<ul>
<li>Although most effects can still be replicated digitally not all of them can.</li>
<li>
<p>The two most commonly used filters are the neutral density and the polariser filters.</p>
</li>
<li>Netrual density filters tone down the bright areas of a scene helping you capture, allowing you to capture even more exposure without having burned out areas. They work by cutting off the amount of light the image sensor gets.</li>
<li>ND filters come in various strengths so you can adjust how effective they are.</li>
<li>The polariser filter is design to eliminate glare and reflections, creating colourful images with more punch and saturation.</li>
<li>TOPTIP: Protect your lens with a skylight or UV filter as it will remove harmful UV rays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tripods and monopods
<ul>
<li>Required for images taken with a long shutter time, otherwise image will be blurry.</li>
<li>As with anything you get what you pay for, some plastic legged models are too unstable.</li>
<li>Payout for a carbon fibre or aluminium legged tripod.</li>
<li>More expensive models come with a spirit level.</li>
<li>A lightweight alternative is a mono pod, which only has one leg but is much more portable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory cards
<ul>
<li>Having at least two memory cards is recommended.</li>
<li>Better read/write speed decrease buffering.</li>
<li>Buffering speeds are important when shooting RAW as the file size is very large.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Batteries and charges
<ul>
<li>Again at least two batteries is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kit storage options
<ul>
<li>When shooting in wet conditions cover the camera in clear plastic and make a hole for the lens.</li>
<li>Keep your kit clean using a lint free damp cloth.</li>
<li>Do not clean optics with anything other than a lint free cloth.</li>
<li>Along with the cloth you can use cleaning fluid, a blower-brush and compressed air to get the job done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
