So I have decided to attempt to get a diploma in digital photography and I thought I would share my course notes. This post is all about lenses.

<h2>Lenses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prime
<ul>
<li>Fixed focal length.</li>
<li>Cheaper.</li>
<li>Lighter.</li>
<li>Better image quality.</li>
<li>Less versatile (can't zoom).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zoom
<ul>
<li>Vary focal length.</li>
<li>More versatile (can zoom).</li>
<li>Don't need to move to get your shot.</li>
<li>Capture subjects without drawing attention to yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wide angle
<ul>
<li>Typically between 18mm and 28mm.</li>
<li>Emphasise the difference in size or distance between foreground / background objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fish eye
<ul>
<li>Distorted wide angle.</li>
<li>More than 180 degree field of view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Telephoto lens
<ul>
<li>Not to confuse with zoom lenses, the lenses magnify.</li>
<li>Good for long distance shots, allows you to take a picture at a long distance as if you were there (presumably less loss than a zoom lens?).</li>
<li>Due to the magnification foreground objects will be cropped out of view.</li>
<li>Good for sports / wildlife.</li>
<li>Due to the amount of glass they are very large in size.</li>
<li>They are heavy so much so, a tripod is often required or use a lens with image stabilisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macro
<ul>
<li>For close up shots.</li>
<li>Good for flowers, insects, jewellery or food.</li>
<li>Most DSLRs have a built in macro mode for near focus between 5-10cm.</li>
<li>Expensive dedicated macro lenses can be purchased, these reproduce the subject at a ratio greater than 1:1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
