I am now a homeowner! Yay!

<p>After years of dreadful student houses and dreadful flats and stupid landlords I have moved into a lovely new build in Chorley with my Fiancee Kirsty. It is a nice 2 up 2 down but it has two toilets, overlooks a brook and to the rear there is a carport and a canal.</p>
