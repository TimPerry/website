This article contains my notes for the IOP course.

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Keep things simple, make the subject the centre of attention.</span></li>
<li>One of the most useful options at your disposal is being able to switch the frame between horizontal and vertical.</li>
<li>Lines
<ul>
<li>Horizontal lines can increase a sense of horizontal movement.</li>
<li>Vertical lines can produce very strong images and convey power, strength and growth.</li>
<li>Diagonal lines can be used to great effect to draw the viewers eyes through the image, creating movement and dynamism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eyes see square images as most static, so frame the subject correctly, i.e. for a fast moving car use a horizontal frame.</li>
<li>Rule of thirds, basically break the image down into 3 rows of 3, creating a grid that allows you to align the subject correctly.</li>
<li>Lines are important, there are three types, horizontal, vertical and diagonal.</li>
<li>Balance
<ul>
<li>Formal balance is a image with symmetry, so if you were to hold it in half it would look similar on both sides.</li>
<li>Informal balance is using an object that has is different to the original subject on one or more sides of the image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perspective
<ul>
<li>Used to give images a different feeling or to emphasis strength or even weakness of the subject.</li>
<li>Forced perspective is when you use perspective to make the subject or object in shot appear larger, small or appear in a different way that in natural.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
