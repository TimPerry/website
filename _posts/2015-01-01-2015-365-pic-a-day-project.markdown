I have decided that 2015 will be a good yearÂ to do the 365 (pic a day) project. Which means I will be taking an image every day for the rest of the year. With my new D750 and all the lenses I could ever want, I should have no excuse but to take lots and lots of lovely picture this year and this project will force me into making use of such a good setup I now have.

<p>Here is a lovely link to my tookapic profile:</p>

<p>tookapic.com will hopefully help me with the 365 project, I presume I get nice rewards for taking pictures etc etc.</p>
