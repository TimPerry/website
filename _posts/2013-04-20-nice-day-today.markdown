Nice day today so I thought I would give the camera a good tryout.

<p>Not really had a chance to take images in the day light, apart from at work, which actually had really good light. With today being such a nice day and am not doing anything so I though I would wash the bike, take some pictures. The images of the bike have been posted on a <a title="New bike &amp; passed my bike test!" href="http://www.timperry.co.uk/2012/11/new-bike-passed-my-bike-test/">old article</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some nice pictures, flowers and that:</p>
