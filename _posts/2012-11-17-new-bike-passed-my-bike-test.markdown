I've finally done it, I have got my full bike license!

<p>Just in time for it to be totally unrestricted as well. I passed by test with <a href="http://racewaysridertraining.com/">Race ways</a> who are just simply amazing. This cannot be said about the previous instructors at <a href="http://www.greenlightridertraining.com/">Green light</a>, not only did they seem to go out of their way to getting tests booked they also appeared to have taught me bad practises, thank for for raceways!</p>
<p>Now for the bike...I have traded in my beloved Honda VT125 Shadow, lord knows it has served me well and I am almost sad to see it go for a Yamaha XJ6 Diversion, I learn on a Naked XJ6 and found the diversion perfect.</p>
