Yesterday was my last day at <a href="http://www.forepoint.co.uk/">Forepoint Ltd</a> although I have learnt a lot over the 2 and a half years I have been there, it left like it was time to move on. Fortunately the BBC in Salford, Manchester were/are hiring so I applied. Long story short, I am starting there on Monday as a Software Engineer in the TV &amp; Mobile Platforms and will be working on products such as iPlayer.

<p>Whilst leaving Forepoint I didn't want to leave behind the framework for WordPress that I had basically written in my own time, so I have open sourced it - if you are interested then please visit the <a href="https://github.com/flexpress">GitHub page.</a></p>
<p>My last day at Forepoint was really nice, they got my loads of good leaving presents, even my lovely G600 mouse that I have come to love in the few months I've had it. Other goodies included a archery for two coupon and a 70 pound amazon voucher. I even got hugs off almost everyone ;)</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Dave Flanagan for the logo on this website, he does some amazing illustrations and you should go check him out on <a href="https://twitter.com/daveflanagan">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>So it's time to move on, I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me at the BBC.</p>
